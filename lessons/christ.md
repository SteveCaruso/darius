Peshitta Mat 5:7: ܛܘܒܝܗܘܢ ܠܡܪܚܡܢܐ ܕܥܠܝܗܘܢ ܢܗܘܘܢ ܪܚܡܐ
"The Merciful One" is a "kenning" for God which could factor in here.
The Greek uses a single verb, ἐλεηθήσονται which makes me want to use /rxm (l-/ but I can't quite feel it out.

CPA Lag Mat 5:10:    ܛܘܒܝܗܘܢ ܗܠܝܢ ܕܪܕܝܦܝܢ ܠܒܕܝܠ ܨܕܩܐ ܕܕܝܠܗܘܢ ܗܝ ܡܠܟܘܬܐ ܕܫܡܝܐ܃
Peshitta:          ܛܘܒܝܗܘܢ ܠܐܝܠܝܢ ܕܐܬܪܕܦܘ ܡܛܠ ܟܐܢܘܬܐ ܕܕܝܠܗܘܢ ܗܝ ܡܠܟܘܬܐ ܕܫܡܝܐ
TR Greek: μακάριοι οἱ δεδιωγμένοι ἕνεκεν δικαιοσύνης ὅτι αὐτῶν ἐστιν ἡ βασιλεία τῶν οὐρανῶν
The Greek could mean "to run after" as well.
In Galilean it's always /bdyl/ without /l-/.
The verb /rdp/ means "to seek/pursue" or "to expel/persecute" which could portray an interesting pun depending on how it's rendered (active or passive) "Those who are persecuted on account of righteousness" vs "Those who seek out righteousness." We can see in Lag that it's active, where in the Peshitta it's passive. The passive, however, is not attested in Galilean.

Peshitta:      ܛܘܒܝܟܘܢ ܐܡܬܝ ܕܡܚܣܕܝܢ ܠܟܘܢ ܘܪܕܦܝܢ ܠܟܘܢ ܘܐܡܪܝܢ ܥܠܝܟܘܢ ܟܠ ܡܠܐ ܒܝܫܐ ܡܛܠܬܝ ܒܕܓܠܘܬܐ
TR Greek: μακάριοί ἐστε ὅταν ὀνειδίσωσιν ὑμᾶς καὶ διώξωσιν καὶ εἴπωσιν πᾶν πονηρὸν ῥῆμα καθ᾽ ὑμῶν ψευδόμενοι ἕνεκεν ἐμοῦ
In Galilean 'when they curse you' could also be /kad layy+IN lkON/ in the present, but the use of the future here might better reflect the use of the aorist in the Greek, it being 
The root /dgl/ or /+lt/ for "to lie" is unattested in Galilean. The most common root is /$qr/.
I need to decide the tense here.

### sentences
- +UbEkON kad y;lO+UN l:kON way;rd:pUN l:kON == Happy are you when they will curse you and chase after you.
