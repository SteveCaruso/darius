Vowels shift about (Sokoloff cites תרנוגלה , תורנגלה , תרנגולה). For "hen" (in the feminine) the vowels are more consistent, so that is the lemma form used here as it would be in the the generic (masculine) form:

- tarngUlIN    == chickens
- tarngUlah    == the chicken
- tarngUlayyah == the chickens

- x:zIr      == pig

- x:zIrAyyah == the pigs

- tOr       == cow
- tOrIN     == cows
- tOrAh     == the cow
- tOrAyyah  == the cows

- bE(ayyN   == eggs
- bE(tah    == the egg
- bE(atah   == the eggs
