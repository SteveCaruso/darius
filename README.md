# Codename DARIUS

Will be published shortly over at [http://learn.galileanaramaic.com](http://learn.galileanaramaic.com).

A long, long time ago I built a learning system for Aramaic and I called it DARIUS — it had a ridiculous acronym. I'm not going to carry it over here.

However, the idea here is the same. Free Galilean Aramaic learning lessons in a format inspired by DuoLingo. 

It's all really lightweight, all of the lessons are in Markdown format. And the code is a bit of a hot mess.
